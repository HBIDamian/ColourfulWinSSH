# ColourfulWinSSH
Colour in SSH Command Line Interface (Windows)

## Update / Archive
Due to the existence of [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal), this GitHub Repo has now become redundent. It's still useful for using it in plain Windows Control Panel and Powershell, but I recomend moving to [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) for your SSH Needs. 
So, this repo will now be set as an archive, and there will be no further updates to this repo.
